# Python-for-Paper
This is python script for our ongoing research work.
In this work, we model crowdsourcing system consisting of a set of requesters, a set of providers, and a platform.
Unlike the existing works, we model the task depreciation past the deadline and providers' punctuality behavior.

This code is used in the simulation of my paer in AAAI HCOMP 2017.
